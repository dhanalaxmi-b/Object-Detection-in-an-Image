Detection of object using trained YOLO network with COCO label datasets.

 The YOLO framework (You Only Look Once) deals with object detection in a different way. It takes the entire image in a single instance and predicts the bounding box coordinates and class probabilities for these boxes. The biggest advantage of using YOLO is its superb speed – it’s incredibly fast and can process 45 frames per second. YOLO also understands generalized object representation.
	
YOLO prints out the objects it detected, its confidence, and how long it took to find them.
